# Neue Fische - Capstone - InCased

This is my capstone project for the Neue Fische Web Development Bootcamp.
I've been given a 4 week timeframe to apply all the skills I have picked up during
the previous 8 weeks of bootcamp. The code of this project includes a working example of my React, CSS, Node.js, Express.js and Mongo DB skills.

## What is InCased

InCased utilizes conditional logic to keep track of your plans.
It becomes incredibly useful, whenever you want to remember something without a specific time in mind or like to think ahead and prepare for any given scenario.

The app allows you to define a specific scenario and plan out actions that you would want to do in case it occured. Now that the scenario and action is saved into your phone, you can forget about it and trust that you've prepared yourself in advance.
In case the scenario does come up, you just need to mention the trigger word to your phone and it will present every action that you had stowed away before.

This works especially well in a scenario where a specific timeframe is not given, so you wouldn't write it in a calendar entry. But it's specific enough to be more than just another todo item.

## Usecase example

In case of "whenever I am at the super market"

- go and buy a gallon of milk,
- check out the latest offers,
- buy some toiletpaper,
- ask if I should buy anything else for my spouse
